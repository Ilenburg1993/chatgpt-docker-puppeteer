Chore: isolated dependency audit fix (from main)

This branch records an `npm audit fix --package-lock-only` run in an isolated branch based on `main`.
No lockfile changes were required compared to `main` at the time of the run.

This PR is intentionally low priority and should not be treated as a recurring reminder. See issue #20 for the dependency upgrade deferral policy.
