Actions artifact scan summary

- Artifacts downloaded to: analysis/actions-check/
- Secrets matches file: analysis/actions-check/secrets-found.txt
- Number of matches: 8 (see file)
- Quick interpretation: matches are metadata and refs in workflow outputs (refs/original/*, workflow path strings), no high-confidence API keys, no PEM private key blocks, no detected AKIA/ghp_/xoxb- tokens.

Recommended verification steps (automated):
1) Run a second-pass gitleaks locally over `analysis/repo-verify` or a new mirror clone.
2) If any sensitive tokens are confirmed, follow the rotation checklist in analysis/notifications/rotation-draft.md.
